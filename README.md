# Zen: Autonomous Code Evolution Engine

**Zen** is an autonomous code system engineered for continuous, high-impact performance enhancement. It leverages deep, cross-repository insights and advanced AI to proactively optimize target codebases.

## Core Capabilities

- **Cross-Repository RAG:** Multi-repository analysis utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for deep contextual understanding across complex environments.
- **Gemini AI Optimization:** Automated, high-velocity generation of code improvement suggestions powered by Google's Gemini models.
- **GitOps Integration:** Zero-friction delivery via integrated branching and automated pull requests (PRs).
- **Precision Scope:** Configurable targeting, allowing optimization efforts to focus on specific files, modules, or directories.
- **Controlled Evolution:** Built-in safety mechanisms ensure predictable, auditable, and traceable changes throughout the evolution process.
